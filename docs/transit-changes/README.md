# Transit changes documentation

All changes in transit traffic must be informed to the transit authorities 60 days in advance.
If the data is available from machine readable interfaces, changes will be automatically detected
and transit authorities notified. If a proper interface is not available for a transit service, the
changes must be notified by filling out a manual form.

To facilitate automatic change detection, NAP reads existing transit route and schedule information
from interfaces provided by transport operators and stores them.
